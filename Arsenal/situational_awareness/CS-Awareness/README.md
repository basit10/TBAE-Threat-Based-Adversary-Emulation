# Situational Awareness BOF
This Repo intends to serve two purposes.  First it provides a nice set of basic situational awareness commands implemented in BOF.  This allows you to perform some checks on a host before you begin executing commands that may be more invasive.

Its larger goal is providing a code example and workflow for others to begin making more BOF files.  It is a companion document of the blog post made here: https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/a-developers-introduction-to-beacon-object-files/

## Making a new BOF
If you want to use the same workflow as this repository, your basic steps are as follows
1. Make a folder that covers the target topic, for example in this repo we are using SA
2. copy base_template into topic/commandname
3. modify the Makefile to have your commandname on the first line, this should be the same as the folder name
4. If doing something other then SA make sure to modify lines 14 / 15 of the makefile as well so its moved to the correct location
5. Make a .cna file in the base of your topic folder and add the commands that you reference.  If you followed this format you can take the helper function readbof from SA.cna

Realistically, this could be compressed into a helper script, but those steps were not taken for this effort.

|netGroupListMembers|netGroupListMembers [groupname] [opt: domain]| Lists group members from the default (or specified) domain|
|netLocalGroupList|netLocalGroupList [opt: server]|List local groups from the local (or specified) computer|
|netLocalGroupListMembers|netLocalGroupListMembers [groupname] [opt: server]| Lists local groups from the local (or specified) computer|
|nslookup|nslookup [hostname] [opt:dns server] [opt: record type]| Makes a dns query.<br/>  dns server is the server you want to query (do not specify or 0 for default) <br/>record type is something like A, AAAA, or ANY.  Some situations are limited due to observed crashes.|
|reg_query|[opt:hostname] [hive] [path] [opt: value to query]|queries a registry value or enumerates a single key|
|reg_query_recursive|[opt:hostname] [hive] [path]| recursively enumerates a key starting at path|
|routeprint|routeprint| prints ipv4 configured routes|
|schtasksenum|schtasksenum [opt: server]| Enumerates all scheduled tasks on the local or if provided remote machine|
|schtasksquery|schtasksquery [opt: server] [taskpath]| Queries the given task from the local or if provided remote machine|
|sc_enum| sc_enum [opt:server] | Enumerates all services for qc, query, qfailure, and qtriggers info |
|sc_qc|sc_qc [service name] [opt:server]| sc qc impelmentation in bof|
|sc_qfailure|sc_qfailure [service name] [opt:server] | Queries a service for failure conditions |
|sc_qtriggerinfo|sc_qtriggerinfo [service name] [opt:server] | Queries a service for trigger conditions |
|sc_query|sc_query [opt: service name] [opt: server]| sc query implementation in bof|
|sc_qdescription|sc_qdescription [service name] [opt: server] | sc qdescription implementation in bof|
|tasklist|tasklist [opt: server]| Get a list of running processes including PID, PPID and ComandLine (uses wmi)|
|whoami|whoami| simulates whoami /all|
|windowlist|windowlist [opt:all]| lists visible windows in the current users session|
|wmi_query|wmi_query query [opt: server] [opt: namespace]| Run a wmi query and display results in CSV format|
|netsession|netsession [opt:computer] | Enumerates all sessions on the specified computer or the local one|
|resources|resources| Prints memory usage and available disk space on the primary hard drive|
|uptime|uptime| Prints system boot time and how long it's been since then|

Note the reason for including reg_query when CS has a built in reg query(v) command is because this one can target remote systems and has the ability to recursively enumerate a whole key.


#### credits
The functional code for most of these commands was taken from the reactos project or code examples hosted on MSDN.  
The driversigs codebase comes from https://gist.github.com/jthuraisamy/4c4c751df09f83d3620013f5d370d3b9

Thank you to all of the contributors listed under contributors.  Each have contributed something meaningful to this repository and dealt with me and my review processes.  I appreciate each and every one of them for teaching me and helping to make this BOF repository the best it can be!

##### compiler used
Precompiled BOF's are provided in this project and are compiled using a recent version of Mingw-w64 typcially installed from brew.
